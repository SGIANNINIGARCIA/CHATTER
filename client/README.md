Realtime Chat Web Application developed using React for the front-end, and Express and SocketIO for the back-end. Before joining the chat, the user is prompted to select a topic and a name. Once this information is submitted, the user is redirected to a chat room where he joins other users with an interest in discusssing the same topic.
